This website is a collection of my ongoing projects that explore the intersection of art, design, and technology. I use p5.js, a JavaScript port of the Java-based language Processing, to create animations that blend elements of mathematics and generative art. I've also been experimenting with vector design using Vectornator.

Thank you for visiting and I hope you enjoy my work!
